# Task-List-Manager-Using-Python
Super excited to share the progress I’ve made in my Python learning journey! This time, I built a simple Task List Manager — a small command-line application that allows you to:
✅ Add tasks
📋 Display the current task list
🗑️ Remove tasks
✏️ Update existing tasks
🔤 Sort tasks alphabetically
While it may seem simple, this project helped me explore and apply some important Python concepts such as:
🔹 Functions – to keep the code clean and modular
🔹 Lists – for storing and managing the tasks
🔹 Loops & Conditionals – to handle the program flow based on user input
🔹 User Input & Output Handling – to make it interactive
🔹 Error Handling – using try-except to manage invalid inputs smoothly
🔹 Sorting – using .sort() to order the tasks neatly
🔹 Indexing – to let users update or remove tasks using task numbers
💡 Every small experiments like this helps me move one step closer to writing real, functional code. It’s not just about learning syntax anymore — it’s about building something, no matter how small, and improving day by day.
I'm staying consistent and motivated through these hands-on experiments — and I’m just getting started!
